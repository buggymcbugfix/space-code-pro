# Space Code Pro
A thinner version of Source Code Pro made for reduced font overglow for light text on a dark background. Space Code Pro `regular` is taken from Source Code Pro `light`. Space Code Pro `bold` is taken from Source Code Pro `regular`. The font files can be downloaded from the `otf` folder.

## Background
I was using Source Code Pro's `light` weight in spacemacs as the regular font was too fat on my high pixel density screen. I couldn't, however, find an easy way to change the weight of the `bold` font, which was disproportionally thick.
